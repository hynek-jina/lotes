## Lotes

**Lightning notes Validator**

The application serves as a validator for bitcoin banknotes.
You can load the banknote with the application. It should contain LNURLw. You then claim this value with LNbits and create another LNURLw. Then you upload the new LNURLw using NFC on the banknote. 

_At this point, you are assured that no previous owner of the note, or anyone who may have previously scanned it, can claim the funds._
